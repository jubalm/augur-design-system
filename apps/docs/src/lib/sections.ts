/**
 * Section overview content (issue #55).
 *
 * The four section overview pages (/foundations, /components,
 * /patterns, /reference) are substantive docs pages: each has a clean
 * `.md` representation and appears in `llms.txt`. Their destinations
 * are never hand-listed — the reading order and page descriptions come
 * from the content collections through this one module, which the
 * rendered pages, the Markdown endpoints, and `llms.txt` all consume.
 *
 * The intro copy is the only authored text here; it is shell content
 * (like the getting-started frontmatter), not a second authoring path
 * for collection content.
