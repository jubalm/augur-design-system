/**
 * llms.txt generation (issue #9).
 *
 * A concise, navigational index for LLM consumers at `/llms.txt`
 * (base-aware: served at `<base>/llms.txt`). It guides retrieval — where
 * authoritative documentation lives — and never restates design rules
 * (ARCHITECTURE.md, "llms.txt"). No speculative llms-full.txt.
 *
 * Single-source discipline: page sections are generated from the same
 * collections that render the site (draft entries excluded, `order` then
 * title), linked directly at their clean `.md` representations; the
 * getting-started entry reuses the shell page's authored frontmatter.
 * When a collection is empty the section says so instead of claiming
 * pages that do not exist.
 *
 * Links are base-aware site-absolute paths (resolvable against this
 * file's URL under both the root and repository-subpath deployments).
 * DESIGN.md / ARCHITECTURE.md / CHANGELOG.md are not served by the docs
 * site; they are linked at their canonical repository locations.
